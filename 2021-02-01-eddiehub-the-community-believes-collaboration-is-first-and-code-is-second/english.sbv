Hi there, I am Eddie

0:00:10.910,0:00:17.600
Our community is called EddieHub

0:00:17.600,0:00:21.850
We believe that collaboration comes first and code comes second

0:00:21.850,0:00:39.819
We are an inclusive open source community that focuses on supporting each other

0:00:39.819,0:00:44.399
No matter where you are in your journey

0:00:44.399,0:00:47.390
Remember even if you only have 1 month experience

0:00:47.390,0:00:49.469
There is someone where you were 1 month ago

0:00:49.469,0:00:55.319
Helping others is a great way to learn and grow your network

0:00:55.319,0:01:01.910
We have my YouTube where you will find lots of tutorials about open source and GitHub

0:01:01.910,0:01:21.050
I also do live streams getting you involved in open source and finding you the green squares

0:01:21.050,0:01:31.890
Also, I bring awesome guests on there to hang out with us

0:01:48.330,0:01:49.330
join

0:01:49.330,0:01:59.830
Just raise an issue on the support repo with the type "invite me to the organisations"

0:01:59.830,0:02:08.610
And the GitHub Action will do all the magic and

0:02:08.610,0:02:17.950
do all the rest, and send you an invitation

0:02:17.950,0:02:34.959
Remember if you would like other people to see you are part of our organisation

0:02:34.959,0:02:40.550
You have to make it public on your profile, only you can do that

0:02:40.550,0:02:54.890
We have many projects in our GitHub organisation from Discord bots written in typescript to

0:02:54.890,0:02:55.890
react frontends

0:02:55.890,0:02:56.950
And everything in between

0:02:56.950,0:03:15.610
